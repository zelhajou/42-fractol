# Fract-ol

## Description
- Fract-ol is a computer graphics exploration project centered around the beauty and complexity of fractals. Using the C programming language and the [MiniLibX](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx) library, this project aims to render stunning visual representations of the Julia and Mandelbrot fractal sets. It serves as a practical application of complex numbers, computer graphics optimization, and event handling in graphics programming.


## Installation
To install Fract'ol, clone the repository and compile the source code using the provided Makefile.

```bash
git clone [repository-link]
cd fractol
make
```
Ensure that the MiniLibX library is installed on your system before compiling.

## Usage
Run the program with the following command:

```c
./fractol [fractal-type]
```
Replace **[fractal-type]** with either **Julia** or **Mandelbrot** to view the respective fractal set. Use mouse and keyboard inputs to zoom, adjust color depth, and explore the fractals.

## Features
- Render Julia and Mandelbrot fractal sets
- Dynamic zoom and color depth adjustment
- Real-time interaction with fractal parameters
